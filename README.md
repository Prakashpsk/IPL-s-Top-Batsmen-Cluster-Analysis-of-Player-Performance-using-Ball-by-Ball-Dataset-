## Introduction
In this project, we delve into the exciting world of the Indian Premier League (IPL) by analyzing ball-by-ball data to identify and cluster the top batsmen. By leveraging advanced clustering techniques, we aim to unveil patterns in player performance and showcase some of the best IPL batsmen of all time.

## Skills/Concepts Developed
- Data analysis and exploration
- Feature engineering
- Clustering algorithms: Kmeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering
- Evaluation metrics for clustering
- Data visualization

## Problem Statement
With the latest and complete IPL dataset at our disposal, our goal is to create clusters of IPL batsmen based on their strengths. By doing so, we aim to highlight the standout performers and legends of the game who have made significant contributions to the IPL.

## Modeling
### Steps:
1. Read the IPL dataset.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to check data quality, handle missing values, etc.
3. Analyze the data and generate relevant features to represent a batsman's performance, such as total runs scored and strike rate.
4. Apply different clustering algorithms (Kmeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering) to the batsmen dataset.

5. Evaluate the clustering results using appropriate performance metrics.
6. Visualize the clustered dataset to identify and showcase the top IPL batsmen.

## Visualization
The clustered dataset will be visualized using plots and graphs to provide insights into the performance and distribution of IPL batsmen across different clusters.

## Conclusion
Through this project, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of player performance in the IPL and identify the top batsmen based on their strengths and contributions to the game. By leveraging clustering techniques, we can uncover hidden patterns and insights that can be valuable for cricket enthusiasts, team strategists, and stakeholders in the IPL ecosystem.

## Recommendations
- Teams and franchises can use the insights from the clustered dataset to make informed decisions during team selection, auctions, and strategic planning.
- Fans and cricket enthusiasts can gain a better understanding of player performance and appreciate the contributions of top IPL batsmen.
- Analysts and researchers can explore further insights from the dataset and conduct more in-depth analyses on player performance and trends in the IPL.
